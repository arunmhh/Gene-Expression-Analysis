# Gene-Expression-Analysis of TCGA_LIHC datasets.

Micro-array Gene expression analysis using R 
NGS data also included for the analysis.
Data from GDC portal for the TCGA-LICH for transcriptome profiling was completely fetch using the **TCGAbiolinks R package**.

Note: Make sure that R version >= 3.3 is installed. For older versions the TCGAbiolinks uses different functions  
starting with "TCGA" rather than "GDC" since the data were moved from DCC server to NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC).
 Make sure that the newest TCGAbiolinks package is installed ( https://github.com/BioinformaticsFMRP/TCGAbiolinks )
